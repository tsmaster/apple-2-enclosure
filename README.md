# apple-2-enclosure
Python code to create PDF plans for a laser-cut enclosure that
resembles an older home computer.

The plan is to cut it out of 1/4" birch plywood, at full size: 17" front-to-back, 15" side-to-side, and 4" inches top-to-bottom.

I'd also like to print the whole thing out at half size to put a tinier (Raspberry Pi C?) machine inside.

# TODO
 - remove (most) of the path lines, to reduce the amount of tab chad generated
 - put (optional) logo on keyboard tray top
 - make cutouts (on back, access panel) optional
 - lase the thing and see how it goes
